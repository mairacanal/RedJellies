# Making Embedded Systems

I started an [embedded systems course](https://classpert.com/classpertx/cohorts/making-embedded-systems) this year to improve my skills in embedded systems. The course offered by Elecia White is based on her book "Making Embedded Systems".

In this repository, I intend to keep my homework assignments and my final project. Probably, at the end of the course, I will commit my notes also.
